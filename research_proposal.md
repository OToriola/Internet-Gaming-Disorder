Title: The Impact of Screen Time and Internet Gaming on Children's Mental Health and Social-Emotional Development: A Machine Learning Approach Using NSCH and IGD Datasets

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
- Rising concerns about children's screen time and gaming behaviors
- Increasing prevalence of Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD)
- Gap in understanding the relationship between screen time patterns and mental health outcomes

1.2 Research Problem
The relationship between screen time, gaming behavior, and children's mental health is complex and not fully understood. While previous studies have examined these factors separately, there is a need for comprehensive analysis using multiple datasets and advanced analytical techniques.

2. Literature Review Summary
2.1 Screen Time and Mental Health
- Current evidence on screen time impacts
- Gaming addiction research
- Social-emotional development in digital age

2.2 Internet Gaming Disorder
- Diagnostic criteria
- Prevalence rates
- Risk factors and protective factors

3. Research Objectives
3.1 Primary Objectives
- Analyze the relationship between screen time patterns and mental health outcomes
- Identify risk factors for Internet Gaming Disorder
- Develop predictive models for early intervention

3.2 Secondary Objectives
- Examine the moderating effects of physical activity and sleep
- Investigate gender differences in gaming behavior and mental health outcomes
- Evaluate the effectiveness of different machine learning approaches

4. Methodology
4.1 Data Sources

   - Sample size: 54,196 children
   - Key variables:
     * Screen time
     * Mental health indicators
     * Physical activity
     * Sleep patterns

b) Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) Dataset
   - Sample size: 395 participants
   - Key variables:
     * Gaming hours (weekday/weekend)
     * IGD diagnostic criteria
     * Social and emotional indicators

4.2 Analytical Approach
a) Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
   - Data cleaning and normalization
   - Feature selection using SHAP analysis
   - Missing data handling

b) Machine Learning Models
   - Random Forest (Accuracy: 98.5%)
   - XGBoost (Accuracy: 98.5%)
   - Gradient Boosting (Accuracy: 98.5%)
   - Logistic Regression (Accuracy: 96.9%)
   - Support Vector Machines (Accuracy: 92.3%)

c) Model Validation
   - K-fold cross-validation
   - SHAP value analysis for interpretability
   - External validation using separate test sets
