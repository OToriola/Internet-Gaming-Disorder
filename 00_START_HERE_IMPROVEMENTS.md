## 🔍 KEY FINDINGS TO FEATURE

### Model Performance
- Test set accuracy: 100% 
- Cross-validation accuracy: 97.65% ± 2.1% (more realistic estimate)
- All 6 models: >95% CV accuracy

### Fairness & Generalization  
- Consistent performance across age groups (15-17 vs 18+ years)
- Sex-stratified analysis shows good discrimination for males (100% recall)
- Supports equitable model deployment across demographics

### Clinical Applicability
- Recommended threshold: **0.30** (not default 0.50)
- At 0.30: ~83% recall + ~75% precision
- Prioritizes sensitivity for screening (minimize false negatives)

### Feature Importance
- Top predictors: Escape motivation, Sleep quality, Screen time
- 6 features capture ~90% of explained variance
- Selection validates clinical understanding of IGD pathophysiology

## 💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### Copying Tables
- Markdown tables can be pasted directly into Word
- Or use online markdown-to-Word converter
- Maintain consistent decimal places (e.g., all 0.9765, not mixed)
- Include table notes explaining abbreviations (SD, N, etc.)

### Adding Figures
- Ensure all figures are 300+ DPI for print quality
- Add descriptive captions (what it shows, why it matters)
- Reference all figures in text ("as shown in Figure X...")
- Maintain consistent font sizes across figures

### Writing About Results
- Don't claim "perfect model" - say "100% test accuracy (validated by CV: 97.65%)"
- Don't say "fair across all demographics" - say "consistent across age groups; sex analysis limited by sample size"
- Do explain why perfect accuracy occurred (small positive case count in test set)
- Do highlight clinical implications of threshold choice

## ❓ QUICK ANSWERS

**Q: Do I need to run Python code?**
A: Not required. All table data is provided. Run code only if you want custom figures.

**Q: Can I skip any components?**
A: Start with copy/paste (Tables 1, 2, 4A, 4B) for guaranteed improvement. Figures are optional but recommended.

**Q: What if figures don't match exactly?**
A: Minor variation is normal (different matplotlib version, etc.). The qualitative story is the same.

**Q: Should I include all 6 models?**
A: No. Focus on top 2-3 (Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost). Mention others in comparison tables only.

**Q: What about the deep learning model?**
A: It's in the full ml_prediction_demo.py but not required. Add if you want to show exploration; otherwise focus on best-performing gradient boosting models.
